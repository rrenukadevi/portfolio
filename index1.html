                <p>In this project ,we propose a Machine Learning(ML) framework for detection of distributed 
                    denial of service attacks using explainable AI. The project aims to detect the DDOS attack 
                    using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm along with KD Tree. This project classifies 
                    DDOS sources at a fine granularity using each IP risk level Compared to previous DDoS detection
                    approaches, this approach outputs explanatory information that enables network 
                    administrators to easily inspect detection results and make necessary interventions.
                    Moreover,achieving more than 95.6% accuracy 
                    in detecting DDoS attacks at line speed.</p>

                    CSS: Styles the popup to be centered and overlays the entire screen with a semi-transparent background.<br>
                    JavaScript: Handles the opening and closing of the popup by toggling its display property.
                    To add functionality for multiple popups, you can expand the addAnotherPopupBtn click event in the JavaScript to dynamically create and display new popup elements This setup allows you to expand your application to handle multiple popups dynamically, each with its unique content and functionality for opening and closing. Adjust the styling and content of popups (popupContent.innerHTML) as per your application’s requirements..</p>
